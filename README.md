# CustomSort
A comfortable way to use the custom high speed sort mechanism.

This sample should demonstrate the usages of custom sort in combination
of items controls.

The target was not to use ListCollectionView in the view model layer.

So in that example its demonstrated how to use the custom sort with
a simple view model.

The only thing what we need is a behavior which activates the custom sort
on the ItemsControl (DataGrid).

This Behavior have a property which represents the information for the 
comparer.

So enjoy it..
